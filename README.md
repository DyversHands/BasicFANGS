## Change History
* 2023-11 - Basic FANGS is currently being revised after a long hiatus, thus should be considered a work-in-progress.
* 2005-05 - I've just finished converting the FANGS 1.6.1 wiki pages based on my master Microsoft Word files, and I have now incorporated all the most recent changes by Steve Perrin. Most of the inter-section links are broken, and I'm sure that I'll find more formatting and other conversion errors, but basically everything is all here now. -- @ChristopherA 15:09, 14 May 2005 (PDT)
* Version 1.6.1 (Started September 3, 2003 -- in progress) -- Steve Perrin's review and update of the 1.6 rules.
* Version 1.6 (September 23, 2002) -- After an eight-year hiatus, I have started modifying the game again. Some changes: 
** Since release of 1.5, there is now D&D 3rd Edition which has a new d20-based system, and an 'open gaming content license' allowing others to release "d20" branded games. Basic FANGS d20 technique in 1.5 is very different, with low rolls being better, but in D&D 3rd Edition d20 high rolls are better. I have attempted to make changes to the Basic FANGS d20 techniques to be more compatible so that they may be used with existing "d20 brand" modules -- there may still be a few errors that I didn't catch. 
** I am switching the text version from .etx text format setext@tidbits.com to wiki format
** I have a better equation for balancing attribute costs, resulting in a number of changes. If you want to know the deep dark depths of game balance, the formula for this curve is success%=(.031831*(tan^-1(0.31831*.1*(actorskill-targetskill)))+0.5 or in Excel =ROUND(0.31831*(ATAN(0.31831*.1*(A1-B1)))+0.5,2) 
* Version 1.5 (January 26, 1994) -- Major update, including converting from a d100 based skill system to a d20 skill system. 
* Version 1.4 (August 17, 1991) -- Final release of wizard and priest rules 
* Version 1.3 (March 23, 1991) -- Limited release of wizard and priest rules. 
* Version 1.2 (August 16,1990) -- Changed font & layout of printed version. Lowered basic knife skill to 40%. Different calculation for initial defense Skills. Increased coin multipliers for Wealth and Rich advantages (again!) Changed the value of the copper piece to 100 coppers for each silver piece; this should make it easier to calculate when purchasing equipment. Price lists are changed accordingly. To convert old prices to new; multiply old cp prices by 4 for cb. New requirements of ST and AG when using shields. New bonus when using both hands to wield a melee weapon. Skills can be practiced up to 75%. You can increase Characteristics up to a maximum of 20 during play (still limited to 18 during character creation.) Added simple combat system. Polished standard combat system. Attack with second weapon is now at -50% penalty. Added optional rules for non-human races as a form of Advantage or Disadvantage. Added Index to printed version. 
* Version 1.1 (February 5, 1990) -- First version for wide release. First release of Skills & Combat sections. Added Stun Points (SP.) Changed calculation of Hit Points and Dodge. Changed initial values for hide & sneak skills. Increased coin multipliers for Wealthy and Rich advantages. Added Hunted advantage. 
* Version 1.0 (July 12, 1989) -- First limited release. 
* Version 0.1 (April 18, 1986) -- Project initiated on CompuServe's Gamers Forum; goals discussed and initial rules proposed.
