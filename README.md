# BasicFANGS
Old school 'skill-based' TTRPG system using d20, with an open license

## Change History
* 2023-11 - Basic FANGS is currently being revised after a long hiatus, thus should be considered a work-in-progress.
* 2005-05 - I've just finished converting the FANGS 1.6.1 wiki pages based on my master Microsoft Word files, and I have now incorporated all the most recent changes by Steve Perrin. Most of the inter-section links are broken, and I'm sure that I'll find more formatting and other conversion errors, but basically everything is all here now. -- @ChristopherA 15:09, 14 May 2005 (PDT)
